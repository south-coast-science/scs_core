SCS device monitor: DEVICE_NAME may have rebooted since LAST_CHECK_TIME
Previous check: LAST_CHECK_TIME
This check: THIS_CHECK_TIME

Reboot: the device uptime is NOW_UPTIME. It was previously OLD_UPTIME.

This may be indicative of a system issue.

If this change of status was intentional, please email South Coast Science support to de-escalate this case.
