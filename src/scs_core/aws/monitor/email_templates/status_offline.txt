SCS device monitor: DEVICE_NAME has changed its status
~
Previous check: LAST_CHECK_TIME
This check: THIS_CHECK_TIME

Changed status: the device DEVICE_NAME was "OLD_STATUS" and is now "NEW_STATUS".

This may be indicative of a system, communications, or power supply issue.

If this change of status was intentional, please email South Coast Science support to de-escalate this case.
