SCS device monitor: DEVICE_NAME has changed its DC input power status
~
Changed status: the device DEVICE_NAME has lost its DC input power.

This may be because of a problem onboard the device, but is most likely because its power supply has lost mains input, or because a cable has become disconnected on either the mains or low voltage DC side. The device's connections should be checked as soon as possible to prevent the device's internal battery from running down.

This check: THIS_CHECK_TIME  Previous status change: PREVIOUS_STATUS_CHANGE_TIME
